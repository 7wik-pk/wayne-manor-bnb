# (DEFUNCT) Wayne Manor Bed & Breakfast

This project is now defunct. I am now working on a revised project on the same concept but with different vision & goals.

Web app/portal to handle bookings and reservations for a fictional bread and breakfast lodge.

- Built in Go version 1.18
- Uses [Gin](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin)
- Uses [gin-contrib/sessions](https://github.com/gin-contrib/sessions) for session management
- Uses [gin-csrf](https://github.com/utrack/gin-csrf)
